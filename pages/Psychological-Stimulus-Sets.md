________________________________________________

I will be happy to include your stimuli from your research or your research group. Please note that the distribution of your content has to accomodate standard academic, scientific and journal editorial requirements for the stimuli to be included here. Consider sending me an email (check the bottom of the bio note at my homepage) and re-sending your email if I do not respond to your request in three days. I ask people to not attach any files to your email because the file might contain viruses or phising attacks(a total bummer!),instead; upload them on a safe, public and easy to access website such as [OSF](https://osf.io/) among other common preferences for me to take a look around.
